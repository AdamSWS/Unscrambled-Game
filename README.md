# Word-Scramble - Made by: Adam Saad
Written completely in C++

Made this for a school project. Fun Program that utilizes C library function rand().

Word-Scramble is exactly what is sounds like. The user inputs a board size and based on the userInput, the compilier will access a dictionary-3to5-letters.txt file to gather sample words. The user will then be prompted to input a number for how many times the board is to be scrambled. After doing so, the user has a menu of options to rotate a row or column, show the completed board, or generate a new one.
